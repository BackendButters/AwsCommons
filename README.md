Common library for shared AWS helpers consisting of artifacts for
* DynamoDB
* Lambda w/ API gateway integration

Next on the roadmap:
* SES artifact
* Pushing to Maven Central

This came out of my private projects where I wanted to spare myself copy&paste and created this library of functionality that I frequently use.
